# About this project

This Android Studio Dark Mode theme app, written in Kotlin, is my first ever project as a beginner Android developer. It provides a sleek and modern dark mode theme for Android users, with a focus on usability and aesthetics. The theme is optimized for readability and ease of use, with carefully chosen color combinations that reduce eye strain and promote focus. This open source project is available on GitHub for others to contribute and make improvements. Thank you for your interest in my project!
